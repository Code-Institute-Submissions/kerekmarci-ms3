# Epic Food Receipe Website - Milestone Project 3

## View live project here: [Epic Food](http://epic-food.herokuapp.com/)

This website was created for my 3rd Milestone Project at the Code Institute. 
The website will utilise the languages and tools I learned so far in Front-End and Back-End, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB.

---

## Description

This project presents a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes.
A visitor can view and access various receipes based on meal types, while a registered user will have access to more functionalities, such as
uploading recipes, amending and deleting their own recipes, as well as leaving comments on recipes.

## User Experience

The aim of this website is to display recipes in a visually appealing and user friendly manner.
Upon loading the page, the navigation bar is present at ta fixed position, highlighting the registration button which is the main goal of the website.
Once the user registers, all features are revealed. Below that, the meal types are shown with eye-catching images, and the recipe cards are loaded below on the main landing page. It is intuitive for the user to click on the recipe (either the name or the image) to access full details.

### Strategy

The main goal of this 3rd Milestone project was to build a website that has both Front-End and Back-End elements and can manipulate data with CRUD operations. Within that, the aim was to create an application that allows users to register to the website, upload, amend and delete recipes, as well as able to browse within recipes while displaying results in a visually appealing way.
