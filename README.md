# Epic Food Receipe Website - Milestone Project 3

## View live project here: [Epic Food](http://epic-food.herokuapp.com/)

This website was created for my 3rd Milestone Project at the Code Institute. 
The website will utilise the languages and tools I learned so far in Front-End and Back-End, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB.

---

## Description

This project presents a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes.
A visitor can view and access various receipes based on meal types, while a registered user will have access to more functionalities, such as
uploading recipes, amending and deleting their own recipes, as well as leaving comments on recipes.

---

## User Experience

The aim of this website is to display recipes in a visually appealing and user friendly manner.
Upon loading the page, the navigation bar is present at ta fixed position, highlighting the registration button which is the main goal of the website.
Once the user registers, all features are revealed. Below that, the meal types are shown with eye-catching images, and the recipe cards are loaded below on the main landing page. It is intuitive for the user to click on the recipe (either the name or the image) to access full details.

### Strategy

The main goal of this 3rd Milestone project was to build a website that has both Front-End and Back-End elements and can manipulate data with CRUD operations. Within that, the aim was to create an application that allows users to register to the website, upload, amend and delete recipes, as well as able to browse within recipes while displaying results in a visually appealing way.

### User stories:

### Scope

The key features of this web application is to be able to manage CRUD operations in MongoDB database:

* **Create:** registered users can upload recipes and comments to the database that can be viewed by others
* **Read:** to view data (recipes) uploaded in MongoDB, with having various options to filter data and display the selected result. Such filters are search by category, search by cooking level and search by keywords
* **Update:** registered users can make changes to any of their own recipes
* **Delete:** registered users can delete their own recipes

### Structure

The website will feature the following:

#### Main Page: 

* Banner on the top of the page with the logo of the website
* Navigation under the logo that has 2 parts: menu bar with text menu and search by meal types with icons
* 6 recipe cards shown with pagination - clicking on the recipes will land on the full individual recipe page
* Section to promote cooking equipment

### Surface

* **Colours:**

For a website that contains a database, I believe that a brigther scheme is more suitable than a dark one.
Being a recipe website, a food-related banner on the top of the page will immediately create a feeling in the user what the entire website is about. This is why an image was selected which is showing some ingredients. A green colour in the theme is a suitable match with the ingredients and food in overall, and brown and orange go well with green. This is why the main colour of the banner is brown, and the various highlights and buttons are either green or orange. The overall white and grey background is neutral and is a good match with any colours.\
The colour palette can be seen here.\

* **Typography:**

For the text content of the website, traditional-looking fonts were selected that are easy to read.  
    - The main font is called *Barlow*. This is a suitable font for both the content and a headlines, with a heavier font-weight for the latter.  
    - To add a little flavour to the titles, the friendly one-liners on the top of each sections are written with a fond called  *Handlee*  

* **Icons:**

FontAwesome icons are used on the recipe cards and on the full recipe pages to add more visual element to the categories, cooking time and number of servings.
